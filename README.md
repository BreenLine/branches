# Branches
A C# program to add branches and calculate the depth of the branches.

## Requirements
- Visual Studio or other .NET development environment

## Usage
- Clone or download the repository
- Open the solution file in Visual Studio
- Run the program and it will allow you to add branches and calculate their depth

## How it works
- The program uses a class called `Branch` to define a branch object, which has a list of branches as its member variable.
- Each time you add a new branch, the depth of the branches will increase by 1.
- The depth of the branches is calculated using a helper function `CalculateDepth`.
